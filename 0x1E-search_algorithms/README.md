# 0x1E-search_algorithms

The 0x1E-search_algorithms project is part of the ALX low level programming curriculum. It covers the implementation of different search algorithms in C. The project includes 10 tasks, each of which implements a different search algorithm. The algorithms covered in the project include linear search, binary search, exponential search, and fibonacci search. The project also includes a unit test suite to test the correctness of the implemented algorithms.


## Tasks

Tasks covered in this project are as follows.

    0. Linear search
    1. Binary search
    2. Big O #0
    3. Big O #1
    4. Big O #2
    5. Big O #3
    6. Big O #4
    7. Jump search
    8. Big O #5
    9. Interpolation search
    10. Exponential search
